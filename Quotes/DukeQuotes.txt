AAhhh... much better!
Bitchin'!
Blow it out your ass! 
Boooorn tooo beee wiiiiiiild... 
Come get some!
Come on! 
Damn....
Damn!
Damn it. 
Damn, I'm good!
Damn... I'm looking good!
Damn, those alien bastards are gonna pay for shooting up my ride.
Damn, that was annoying!
Damn, that's the second time those alien bastards shot up my ride!
Damn, you're ugly.
Die, you son of a bitch! 
Eat shit and die.
Get that crap outta here!
Get back to work, you slacker!
Go ahead, make my day.
Gonna rip 'em a new one.
Groovy!
Hail to the king, baby! 
Heh, heh, heh... what a mess!
HHHHHHHHHHHEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
Hmm, don't have time to play with myself.
Hmm, that's one "Doomed" Space Marine.
Holy cow!
Holy shit!
I'll rip your head off and shit down your neck.
I'm Duke Nukem - and I'm coming to get the rest of you alien bastards!
I'm gonna get medieval on your asses!
I'm gonna kick your ass, bitch!
I'm gonna put this smack dab on your ass!
I ain't afraid of no quake!
I should have known those alien maggots booby-trapped this sub.
It's time to kick ass and chew bubble gum... and I'm all outta gum.
It's down to you and me, you one-eyed freak! 
It's time to abort your whole freaking species!
Let God sort 'em out!
Let's rock!
Looks like cleanup on aisle four.
Lucky son of a bitch.
Mess with the best, you will die like the rest
My boot, your face; the perfect couple.
No way I'm eating this shit!
Nobody steals our chicks... and lives!
Now this is a force to be reckoned with!
Oh...your ass is grass and I've got the weed-whacker.
Ooh, I needed that!
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.
Piece of Cake.
See you in Hell!
Shake it, baby!
Shit happens.
Sometimes I even amaze myself.
Staying alive, staying alive, la. 
Suck it down!
Terminated!
This really pisses me off!
This is KTIT, K-Tit! Playing the breast- uhh, the best tunes in town.
That's gonna leave a mark!
We meet again, Doctor Jones!
What? There's only one of you?
What are you waitin' for? Christmas?
What are you? Some bottom-feeding, scum-sucking algae eater?
Where is it?
Who wants some?
Why so serious, Sam?
Wohoo!
Yeah, piece of cake!
Yippie ka-yay, motherfucker!
You guys suck!
You're an inspiration for birth control.
Your face, your ass - what's the difference?
You wanna dance? 
COME GET SOME!!!
Dying ain't much of a living, boy.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your chicks.
Have you seen my rubber...duckie?
Hello? McFly? 
Hey! Get your ass out of here and bring me back my chicks!
I'll blow you a new hole!
I'm God's gift to women!
I love the smell of bacon in the morning.
I make this look good. 
Lara, is that you? 
Looks like it's TIME TO KILL!
My home away from home! 
I prefer a good cigar, and a bad woman!
Gimme a Jack and Coke anyday!
Suck my boom stick! 
The bigger they are, the more they bleed!
…and I thought cigars smelled bad!
There's a new sheriff in town.
You'll make a great belt.
Little pig, little pig, let me in. Or I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll kick your ass in!
Rubba-dub-dub. Get out of the tub.
It's locked, and I'm an ass kicker not a safe cracker.
Mmmm! Who wants bacon and eggs? 
So much for the new boots...Has anyone seen Mr. Hankey?
Is it true that Roman girls have Roman hands?
Lizard skin makes great boots.
Not in this lifetime!
Where's Doc Brown when ya need him?
Who wants some?
Hey... what can I say?
Come on!
All aboard!
Let's settle this once and for all!
I'll kick you in the "nuts"!
Oh Yeah!
Ahhhhhhhh!
Shake it, baby!
I'm an ass kicker not a rock digger.
Die, you overgrown winged lizard from Hell!
Shut your hole!
What are you waiting for, Christmas?
IT'S ASS-KICKING TIME!
"Mmm, it's good to be king!"
Blow it out your ass!
Your face, Your ass what's the difference?
Don't worry about it, saving chicks is what I'm all about!
I ain't got time to bleed!
Who the hell are you? My evil twin? 
Alien boys, there's a new sheriff in town.
I don't die that easy boys. Come on time for a jail break.... by balls.
I'm an ass kicker, not an aviator.
It ain't no bike, but﻿ it sure beats the hell outta walking. 
Squeal piggy ! Squeal shove it in here !
Oh boy, it's clobberin' time!
Eh... Just a flesh wound.
nuts roasting... as I open fire 
Ahhh, smell those traffic fumes. And no damn aliens! Time for some R & R!
Hey kids you remember i'm a professional, don't try this at home!
What the fuck is goin' on here?!
This won't buuuudge.
Looks like the crap has hit the fan.
Time for the shit 
It ain't no bike but it sure beats the hell out of walking
Marine: I'm cocked, locked, and ready to rock Duke!
Mess with the best, die like the rest
I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?
Great, what am I supposed to use, harsh language?
Well, enough talk then. Come get some! Oh, Silverback, one more thing. I'm gonna enjoy pissin' on your dead body!
Welcome to "Cool's-Ville", Population: Me. 
I'm your worst nightmare, you uninvited alien scum-sucker! And right now you're all that stands between me and a planet full of babes - so get ready to bend over and kiss your ass goodbye!
I'm climbing a ladder........to heaven.
Suck my dick you little alien fucks! 
That hurt you more than it hurt me.
Damn you're ugly!
Bug off!
You guys suck!
The Bigger they are the harder they fall
New York! It's my kind of town. If I can kill 'em here...I can kill 'em anywhere! 
Aaah, I love the smell of sewers in the morning. I bet Morphix is hiding under a turd somewhere.
Ahh, something smells rotten around here.
Ahh, that’s better! (toilet)
All aboard the Midtown Express... to hell!
You must be 18 or older to ride.
Babes, bullets, bombs. Damn - I love this job! 
Batteries not included!
Bingo, the motherload! Sorry Morphix, I'm gonna have to flash your G.L.O.P.P. factory!
Call me now, for your free whipping!
Come on out, Morphix. There's only two ways this can end, and in both of them... you die!
Confucius say... Die! 
Crouching mutant, hidden pipebomb! 
Dance for me, baby! 
Death before Disco! 
Die, bitch! 
Don't get your panties all in a bunch. 
Don't worry girls, there's plenty of Duke to go around. 
[beep, beep, beep] The number you have reached: 9-1-1 has been changed to a non-published number.
End of the line - last stop: Total destruction! 
Get ready for big trouble in little China. Duke style! Morphix, I'm right on your heels!
Gotta find the exit now. 
Guns don't kill mutants, I kill mutants!
Half man, half animal, all dead! 
Hey, careful with those things!
Hey, I know this classy place where you put quarters into the bed and... 
Hmm, that stuff doesn’t look bio-degradable.
Hmm, so there is life after death...
Hmm, no lights... must be part of Morphix's energy conservation plan.
Hmm... the other white meat. 
Hmm, wonder what this does.
I always said, if there was a way to go, it'd have something to do with women, whips, and oil... Let's rock.
I am the king of the world, baby!
Ooh, I better get the hell out of here!
I'm﻿ an equal opportunity ass kicker!
I'm not gonna fight you, I'm gonna kick your ass!
I can do this all day... 
I could use some new boots.
I don't do windows.
I did not have sexual relations with that robot.
I go where I please, and I please where I go.
I hate pigs! 
I kill bugs... Dead! 
I like big guns, and I cannot lie. 
I love the smell of bird crap in the morning.
I see dead people.
I want a damn refund! This cruise sucks!
It's a good day to die! 
It's clobbering time!
It's my way or... Hell, it's my way!
It's gear stripping time! 
Let's rock! 
Life is like a box of ammo.
Looks like I'm on Candid Camera
Looks like Morphix puts workers' safety first... Right after everything else
Looks like your hardware's gone a little soft, Morphix! 
Looks like you've gotten ahead of yourself there.
Looks like we're about to reach our final destination. 
Makin'... bacon!
Mimic that!
Morphix and his G.L.O.P.P. rig are going down faster than Enron. Let's rock.
Mother F-[beep] keycards!
My gun's bigger than yours. 
No goin' back now!
No token? No ride! 
No disassembly required. 
Now I'm really pissed off!
Oops, I did it again! 
Ooh, that's gonna leave a mark.
Pigs will fly before Morphix rules the world on my watch!
Pucker up, buttercup! 
Rest in pieces!
Say hello to my little friend!
Sewer scum!
Should've stayed in the swamp! 
So many babes, so little time.
So much for the rat pack! 
So, who wants to dance?
Someone's gonna pay for making me find these friggin' key cards! 
Something tells me this won't pass any safety inspections...
Sometimes I even amaze myself. 
Son of a bitch!
Sorry, honey, I've got some ass kickin' to do first!
Squeal like a pig!
Stop eyeballin' me!
Surprise, surprise, I need a keycard.
Take that, you dirty rat!
The deeper I go, the worse this city smells! 
This is why I have games named after me!
Time for mutation-mutilation! 
Time for a reboot! 
Time to deliver max pain on the A-Train... now where'd I put that subway token?
Time to de-worm the Big Apple! 
This'll be a barrel of laughs! 
This room is bugged. 
This train is going nowhere fast. 
This thing’s a train wreck waiting to happen.
The queen must be around here somewhere… That bitch is gonna pay!
What a pussy!
What am I? A frog? 
What the hell does Morphix need all this G.L.O.P.P. for?
Where is a light switch when you need one?
Who wants to glow in the dark? 
You’re beautiful when you dying. 
You're goin' down faster than the XFL! 
You're starting to bug me. 
You are the missing link. Goodbye. 
Your kung-fu is through! 
Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of Duke Nukem. My continuing mission: to explore strange new babes, to seek out new aliens and kick their asses.
Jeez… You’d think Morphix could afford a few light bulbs?
I oughta break a broomhandle off in your ass.
Quit wasting my time.
Okay, cycloid shithead, happy now? 
Take your tentacles back to Japan, you freak!
Take those tentacles and shove `em up your ass! 
My balls, your face.
Have a taste of my ball!
All right, time for my reward! 
Looks like those alien bastards drank all my beer.
[slapping alien breasts] Got milk?
Hmm... convenient.
Holy shit!
I'm from Las Vegas, and I say: kill 'em all.
I guess pigs DO fly! 
It's down to you and me!
It's good!
No! Come on! No! 
I'm the Duke, I'm A-number 1.
Now what am I doing? 
Oh yeah! I'm bringing sexy back.
A turd in the hand is worth two in the bush.
Power armor is for pussies! 
Size only matters when you're full grown, baby!
This is taking forever. Time to stop pissing around and get this big guy back into action. Woah, that water's cold.
Tonight, You dine in hell! (reference from the movie 300)
A crowbar would come in handy right about now.
[after solving a gear puzzle] Duke one, gears none.
Bonjour, le hot stuff.
Squeal piggy! Squeal
Dammit Leroy! 
That's one Dead Space marine 
America, fuck yeah 
Good, Bad, I'm the guy with the gun! 
Crumble like a shit cookie! 
I don't dig on swine. 
Douche.
I'm going to kill you old style.
I hate valve puzzles! 
[barrels rolling down a long stairway] Where's a hammer when you need one?
[after killing the foe throwing barrels] Huh, I was expecting a monkey.
You've got a lot of guts. Let's see what they look like. 
I'd buy this for a dollar.
If I promised to kill you last, I lied. 
Duke wins.... Fatality! 
If it bleeds, I can kill it 
What am I, a Chimpanzee? 
What's new, pussycat? 
What kind of sick motherfucker picks up wet feces? 
What the hell?
Yeah, this should help.
Yeehaw, motherfucker! 
Vroom vroom, motherfucker! 
You wanna touch it, don't you? 
You're one ugly motherfucker.
I got balls of steel!
Who wants white meat? Who wants it?
Dear diary... Jackpot!
Seriously, a nut-less monkey can do your job
This is gonna fuck up my hair!
I've got balls of fail!
Time to redecorate, in brain matter grey.
Dick!
Quit bleeding, pussy!
Another day, another disembowelment.
Just call me "Frankenstein."
Aww, and it got such good gas mileage! 
Time to paint the town red 
Pork chop sandwiches! 
"Die you metal motherfucker."
"I've got balls balls balls balls of Steel" 
"Looks like you're last years model."
"One more for the scrapyard."
"Nothin' but scrap metal."
"Freakin' impostor."
"I hate to kick my own ass but it's gotta be done."
"I don't dig on mines."
"You can't beat the real thing baby."
Often imitated never duplicated.
"Damn, I wouldn't want to lose to me either."
Why so serious?"
